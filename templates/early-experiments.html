   <p class="lead">Jeremy Nelson's early experiments with using NoSQL and 
    other technologies for bibliographic began in 2007 when he was employed as the 
    Electronics Resources and Government Documents Librarian at Western State 
    College (now <a href="http://www.western.edu/">Western State Colorado University</a>)
    in Gunnison Colorado.</p>

   <p>In 2008, <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> announced a new cloud 
   PAAS (Platform-as-a-Service development environment they called 
   <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine (GAE)</a>. This preview
   offered a Python-based application SDK loosely based on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>
   that ran on Google's cloud and access to Google Data storage technologies through the 
   underlying GAE APIs. 
   </p>
   <p>
   To explore this new environment, Nelson created three GAE applications, a GovDocs Manager for handling the shipping
   lists in the material processing workflow of Federal and Colorado State documents, an application for 
   tracking recording usage for print magazines and scholarly journals, and finally a "eLibrary" that presented a display 
   of electronic resources organized by title, subject, and popularity.
   </p>
   <p>
   Before GovDocsManager and Serials Management GAE applications,
   accomplishing these tasks involved complicated manual workflows using paper tracking marks and fragile 
   Microsoft Access databases that provenance.

      <p>The serials management GAE application was a replacement of an existing manual process that involved librarian or
      staff to make a pencil hash mark on a paper form that was then tallied and entered into a Microsoft Access Database a 
      couple times a year. The application keep a list of the physical serials still being subscribed to by the library, where
      staff entered an entry every time an item was reshelved, offering near realtime metrics into the usage of serials in 
      the library.</p>
      <p>During the cost cutting measures of the worst years of the 2008 recession, this application was critical in the
       decision to retain or cut a serial from the library's steeply declining budgets during these years.</p>

       <p>The E-Library project at WSC was the cumulation of the experiences developing the GovDocsManager and Serials Management
        Google App Engine. The purpose of the E-Library was explained in a 2010 Code4Lib Article,
